## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
ktunnel runs a tunnel over [grpc](https://grpc.io/) from kubernetes to your local machine.
ktunnel was born out of the need to access my development host when running applications on kubernetes. I specifically found it to be a challenge to run a [remote pycharm debuuger](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/remote-debugging-with-product.html#remote-debug-config) on pods in a kubernetes development cluster. 
The aim of this project is to be an holistic solution to this specific problem(accessing the your local machine from a kubernetes pod) - although there are partial solutions to this problem such as [inlets](https://github.com/inlets/inlets) and [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) I found them to be unsuitable and insecure for the task at hand.
If you found this tool to be helpful on other scenarios(accessing a seeded development database/mocking a service and whatnot) I would love for us to communicate on that.
