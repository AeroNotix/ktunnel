## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
Ktunnel was born out of the need to access my development host when running applications on kubernetes. I specifically found it to be a challenge to run a [remote pycharm debuuger](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/remote-debugging-with-product.html#remote-debug-config) on pods in a kubernetes development cluster. 
Although there aren't many use cases that would justify establishing this kind of connection, I have found the tunnel to be super helpful. The aim of this project is to be an holistic solution to this specific problem(accessing the your local machine from a kubernetes pod) - although there are partial solutions to this problem such as [inlets](https://github.com/inlets/inlets) and [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) I found them to be unsuitable and insecure for the task at hand.
If you found this tool to be helpful on other scenarios(accessing a seeded development database/mocking a service and whatnot) I would love for us to communicate on that.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
You should have proper permissions on the kubernetes cluster

### Installing
Clone the project

```
git clone https://github.com/omrikiei/ktunnel; cd ktunnel
```

Build the binary

```
CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -ldflags="-s -w"
```

You can them move it to your bin path

```
sudo mv ./ktunnel /usr/local/bin/ktunnel
```

Test the commamd
```
ktunnel -h
```
